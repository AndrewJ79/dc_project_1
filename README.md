Economic Impact on Consumer Auto Loans - Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project analyzes the impact of various economic factors (such as GDP, finance rates, average loan amounts, and delinquency rates) on consumer behavior in the auto loan market. Using historical data, we explored correlations between these factors to understand how economic conditions affect consumer lending trends and risks. The analysis includes visualizations and statistical metrics to highlight key relationships and insights.

Project Goals
Investigate how economic factors like GDP and finance rates influence consumer behavior in auto loan markets.
Analyze trends in average loan amounts, finance rates, and delinquency rates.
Provide insights that are valuable for stakeholders, including lenders, policymakers, and consumers.
Key Findings
Moderate negative correlation between GDP and average loan amounts, indicating that as GDP rises, consumers tend to borrow smaller amounts for auto loans.
Moderate positive correlation between finance rates and delinquency rates, suggesting that higher finance rates increase the likelihood of delinquency.
