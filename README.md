Economic Impact on Consumer Auto Loans - Data Analysis Project

Overview

This project analyzes the impact of various economic factors (such as GDP, finance rates, average loan amounts, and delinquency rates) on consumer behavior in the auto loan market. Using historical data, we explored correlations between these factors to understand how economic conditions affect consumer lending trends and risks. The analysis includes visualizations and statistical metrics to highlight key relationships and insights.

Project Goals

-Investigate how economic factors like GDP and finance rates influence consumer behavior in auto loan markets.

-Analyze trends in average loan amounts, finance rates, and delinquency rates.

-Provide insights that are valuable for stakeholders, including lenders, policymakers, and consumers.

Key Findings

How does the health of the economy impact the average amount financed in consumer buying habits?
  Through our analysis we found the change in GDP had a moderate negative correlation of -0.58 with the change in the average amount financed over time. In addition, these data sets yeilded a p-value of 6.2e-06, demonstrating that this correlation in unlikely to be a result of random chance. Thus, we can predict that as the GDP increases, the average amount financed for consumer purchases will decrease.
  
How does the change in the amount financed affect interest rates?
  When comparing the indicator pair of amount financed and financed rates we found there to be no correllation as the pair yeilded an r-value of -0.03. The analysis also revealed a p-value of 0.83, further demonstrating that this specific pair are not connected. As a result, we can conclude that lenders do not take the financing amount into consideration when setting the financing rate.
  
How do the interest rates of financing agreements affect the rate at which consumers default on their payments?
  Conducting a third analysis between the finance rate and delinquency rate pair, we foud their to be an r-value of 0.36 and a p-value of 0.009. This shows that there is a statiscally significant positive correlation between these two rates. This can largely be attributed to lenders safeguarding their loaned capital by issuing higher interest rates to those who are more likely to default on their payments.

Conclusions

Lenders/ Policymakers - The correlation between the financing rate and the rate at which debtors do not pay back their loans indicates that lenders are able to identify indivduals who are likely to default. However, the lack of a strong correlation between these rates could also indicate that there are instances in which a high deliquency risk erroneously leads to an increased finance rate.

Consumers - The lack of correlation between the amount financed and the finance rate should be reassuring for many consumers as they can be assured that if they forsee need to take out a loan for a larger expenditure, such as an car purchase, the rate will not change dependant on the amount they wish to finance.
